                                This is my Bat Signal. This is how I live my
                                professional life. Design-in-code is core to my
                                operation. So much could be said about this
                                quality. To be concise, I always had an
                                appreciation for design. It's what led me to
                                becoming a developer by trade. My first full
                                time job was at an agency that is run by
                                designers and architects. It was there that I
                                learned how vital design is to the success of a
                                project. It was at my current job that I really
                                picked up on how valuable being able to speak
                                the language of design as a developer can be.

                                <strong>For example,</strong> HAMR is the
                                project that I've been working on for the past 7
                                years at 3M. I know my way around Figma very
                                well, but for the most recent version of HAMR
                                (v2, freshly/successfully rolled out ðŸŽ‰), I was
                                able to re-design fully in codeâ€”a large nod to
                                y'all for that one ðŸ˜‰.

                                Can very much thank MBLM for this oneâ€”at least
                                professionally. I have experience as a "pixel
                                perfectionist" in the extremes of workplace
                                environments, one end being the classic digital
                                design agency and the other being an
                                multinational conglomerate where being extremely
                                lean is vital to survival. (
                                <strong>Note:</strong> It's very difficult to
                                convince one of the world's largest companies'
                                employees that your thing will be better than
                                the thing they currently use. Jacob's Law ain't
                                a joke.) <br />

                                <strong>Bottom line:</strong> Being able to work
                                where "good enough" is permanently replaced by
                                "fanatical about polish" sounds like a place
                                where I can thrive.

                                These three points exist in tandem for me, both
                                in my professional and personal
                                design/development life.

                                On the professional side, I mentioned before
                                that it's extremely difficult to convince a
                                workforce to transition from their current thing
                                to my more modern and prettier thing. That's why
                                I was brought into 3M 7 years ago and have
                                stayed to this point. I've been able to
                                consistently discover and apply new
                                technologies/optimizations to achieve the
                                unachievable by other software being used. (Eg.
