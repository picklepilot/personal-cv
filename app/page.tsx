                        Firstly, I have exclusively been using TailwindCS/UI as
                        a front-end framework solution in every project for
                        several years. Your job posting, specifically the "Who
                        you are" section, seemed tailor-made to me for the most
                        part. It would only make sense to let me explain by

                                enterprise and has way too many bells and
                                whistles for most use cases. I've been jonesing

                                table that could easily be powered by an
                                external datasource composable. Mainly, I'm

                    her considering many of my good qualities have come from
                    her. And then there's our 8 year old Wheaten, Harvey. He's
                    definitely got... qualities.
